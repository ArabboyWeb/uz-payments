## Sandbox Validation Status

**Pending**: Simulated only.
A local offline harness successfully mocked Payme callbacks and ensured the SDK adheres perfectly to Payme specs (12-hour timeout, tiyin positive validation, signature encoding). However, real Payme-hosted Sandbox integration validations remain pending since they require official Payme Merchant registration credentials to execute a live ingress test.

## Remaining Risks

- No official Sandbox interaction has been tested.
- Missing merchant account checks.
- Organizations must handle rollback and disaster recovery.

## Organization Adoption Status

**Status: organization-ready release candidate, pending merchant-side Payme sandbox validation.**

This SDK is safe to trial on Payme's sandbox. Do not flip to production payments until this final validation report contains live sandbox check successes.
